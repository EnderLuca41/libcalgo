This just a collection of different algorithms that I wanted to write,
Use it for whatever you want (for example as a refrence), but be aware of [the license](LICENSE).

## Compatibility
All Algorthms are written to run on a Little-Endian x86 or x86-64 mashine,
there are maybe more incompatibilities because I only tested it on my home computer.
I test every algorithm that I write, but there are maybe some edge-cases that I didn't thought about.
